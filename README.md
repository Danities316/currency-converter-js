# Currency-Converter using Javascript/nodejs and some API's

I build this project with the intention to understand the functionality of how async await(Javascript asynchrounous) work and to also get a bit deeper into understanding how API manipulations works.

## Overview
Create a Currency converter app that would enable users convert any currency(base) in the world to his desired currency(desired) with a simple UI using exchange Rate and countries API's, Boostrap and Express-handlebars**


### The challenge

My challenge was to have hand on experience of how async/await methodology in javascript by building a small project using this two API's [currency exchange API](https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/${process.env.CAPI_KEY}/latest/${fromCurrency}) and [Country](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/currency/${toCurrency}) so that user would be able to:
>> Convert any country currency to his desired countries and know which countries he can use it

## My process
- I used googleapis for the font by @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Manrope:wght@800&display=swap');
- I Creatively create responsive landing page using boostrap 5, i was greatly inspired by the work of others projects
- I simply fetch currency exchange API data using **Axios**, creat a function to get all the data, extract the rates for each country(rates), calculate the country base currency(baseCurrency) and calculate the exchange rate(baseCurrency * rates[toCurrency].
- Deploying the project to Heroku - I have to understand the steps and process of hosting nodejs project on the cloud

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Boostrap 5
- express
- Express-handlebars
- currency exchange API
- Countries API

### What I learned
- Fetching API data and manipulating them
- How to use async/await, it functionalities and manage errors
- Deep understanding of How to manipulate API data
- How to create mobile-first project
- Deploying project to either Heroku or any other cloud base services


### Continued development
- I would like to create modularity in the file structure -  following webpack standard
- I would like to upgrade the currency converter to a more functioanl and usable app
